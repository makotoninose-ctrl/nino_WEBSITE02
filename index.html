                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Makoto Ninose is responsible for new business development and experiential project design at Culture Convenience Club (CCC), working across mobility, outdoor, food, and regional lifestyle domains. By leveraging CCC's core strengths—such as place-making expertise represented by TSUTAYA and T-SITE, editorial thinking, and membership data—he develops sustainable business models in collaboration with corporations, local governments, and communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He has led a wide range of initiatives, including mobility- and EV-driven experiential events and pilot hubs, regional revitalization projects utilizing underused land and facilities, co-creation marketing programs with automotive manufacturers and dealerships, and new ventures centered on food systems, primary industries, game meat, and circular economy concepts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than focusing on short-term promotions or one-off events, Ninose emphasizes building long-term businesses, creating mechanisms that generate ongoing engagement and relationships, and shaping narratives that can endure as culture. His strength lies in designing projects end-to-end—from concept and planning through implementation, commercialization, investment, and scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By bridging data and creativity, local contexts and global perspectives, and physical and digital experiences, he works to create value that allows companies and regions to remain relevant, connected, and loved over time. Through mobility and lifestyle as entry points, he continues to explore and implement future-oriented models that naturally connect people, places, and society.
